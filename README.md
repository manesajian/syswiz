syswiz
================

Currently this is a convenient place for me to throw odds and ends, programming tidbits generally related to data structures, algorithms, and systems programming. Probably mostly in C and Python. Eventually the idea is to pull a variety of functionality into a "system wizard" with an interactive mode as well as command-line invocations.
